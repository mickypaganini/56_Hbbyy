# The function to use ("DoubleCB" for doubles-sided Crystal Ball function, 
# "CBGA" for Crystal Ball + Gaussian function, "GAx3" for triple-Gaussian,
# "BifurGA" for bifurcated Gaussian), "Landau" for a Landau function, "Voigt"
# for a Voigtian, and "CBPlusVoigt" for Crystal Ball + Voigtian:
SignalFunctionalForm:		Landau
